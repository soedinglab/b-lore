        It is a sparse matrix (of 0s and 1s) represented here as a list of lists. 
        Each list element, representing a row of the matrix, is another list of non-zero column positions.
        A matrix M = [[1 0 0 0]

                      [0 1 0 1]]
        would be represented as [[0], [2], [1,3]]
        We use a branch and bound algorithm (see text / note example below) to generate zstates.
        For covariates, all z's are 1 z = [1 1 1 ... 1]
        
        Input: nsnps    number of snps in the locus
               cmax     maximum number of causal SNPs allowed

               target   proportion of maximum likelihood to account for
               
        Example: Consider a set of 4 SNPs
                 Initial zstates with ||z|| = 1 are 
                     [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
                 Assuming states [1] and [3] can account for 98% of the maximum likelihood,
                 our new ztstates for ||z|| = 2 would be
                     [[0,1], [1,2], [1,3], [0,3], [2,3]]
                 Again, if [0,1] and [1,3] can account for 98% of the maximum likelihood,
                 then for ||z|| = 3, our new zstates are
